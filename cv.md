## About me

My goal is to gradually change the field of activity and switch to remote work in the field of web development. It is important for me to gain new knowledge and develop existing soft skills in order to avoid stagnation in work and self-development. Dialogue with a team of like-minded people is also important to me, which is why I study at the Rolling Scopes school.
